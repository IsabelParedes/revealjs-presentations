- [x] Add a target scenario and bring it up throughout the other slides
- [ ] Add a screenshot of the proposal for ROSCon

Move QR code to the end of demos

Move demos after conclusion but before future work

- [x] Talk about the workflow or write some documentation and point people there


## Target Users
- **Beginner.** No programming experience
- **Students.** University students with some programming knowledge
- **ROS User.** obvious
- **Roboticist.** Researcher, robotics instructor

## UI
- **Non-interactive.** obvious
- **Minimal.** start/stop node
- **Basic.** publisher and subscriber
- **Intermediate.** topics, services, request evn info
- **Advanced.** full control, modify parameters, bag files, visualizations
- **Complete.** build packages from the browser and connect to external robots

## Technical complexity
1. middleware replacement
2. cross-compile one package
3. comms between pub and sub
4. multiple nodes and distinct topics
5. manipulate a robot
6. rcl from JupyterLite
7. visualizations with Amphion and Zethus
8. simulation with Gazebo
9. workspace for creating and debugging packages
